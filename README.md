## 🔍 About LENS

<img align="right" src="assets/figs/logo.png" width="300px" />

**LENS** is a multi-level benchmark explicitly designed to assess MLLMs across three hierarchical tiers—Perception, Understanding, and Reasoning—encompassing 8 tasks and 12 real-world scenarios.

### 🌟 Key Features

  ***3.4K*** contemporary photographs and ***40K*** domain-specific question-answer pairs are fully human-annotated and reviewed by domain experts.

- **Fresh and Diverse Images**  
  About 53\% of the images are from ***2025*** and more than 80\% of the images are from after ***September 2024***, capturing up-to-date visual content from ***12*** real-world scenarios.

- **Fine-Grained Category Annotations**  
  Over ***300*** fine-grained visual categories are included, allowing for a more precise evaluation of MLLM understanding.

- **Open-Ended Evaluation Protocol**  
  The benchmark supports over ***65*** distinct question styles, reflecting the diversity of real-world user intents.

- **Challenging Cognitive Tasks**  
  Tasks are specifically designed to evaluate **functional visual intelligence**, pushing models beyond pattern recognition toward reasoning and understanding.

## 🎯 Our Vision

The emergence of models like **OpenAI o1** and **DeepSeek-R1** marks the beginning of the Large Reasoning Model (LRM) era. 
By combining the semantic power of LLMs with the systematic, multi-step reasoning abilities of LRMs, we are approaching System 2-level intelligence—and facing a new wave of opportunities and challenges for the computer vision (CV) community.

We seek to bring together researchers from **computer vision**, **multimodal learning**, and **large language models** to:

- Identify open research challenges in multimodal reasoning  
- Share insights from different domains  
- Foster collaboration across disciplines

LENS aims to serve as a rigorous, extensible foundation for future MLLM benchmarking and development.

## 📅 Schedule
- [ ] **Model Release**: The evaluation framework and associated models will be released upon completion of final validation.
- [ ] **Dataset Release**: All annotated datasets used in our benchmark will be made publicly available after paper acceptance.
- [ ] **arXiv Submission**: A preprint of the paper will be submitted to arXiv shortly.
- [ ] **Competition Launch**: A public challenge will be organized based on the proposed benchmark.

## 🧩 Subtask Samples

<div align="center"><em>A showcase of sample data from different subtasks.</em></div>

We formulated a set of open-ended, language-driven tasks to evaluate generative Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs):

- **Described Object Counting**: Estimating the number of object instances described by a class name or free-form expression, often under challenging conditions like occlusion, scale variation, or clutter.
- **Object Detection**: Identifying and localizing objects within an image by generating bounding boxes paired with corresponding class labels. To better match real-life scenarios and practical applications, we had annotators construct over 300 fine-grained object categories (e.g., "Coke" and "Sprite" as distinct categories) based on natural language and common sense, ensuring that one category could correspond to multiple objects in the image.
- **Object Existence Determination**: Determining whether a specific object or category exists in the image without requiring spatial localization.
- **Relation Extraction**: Identifying semantic relationships (e.g., "holding," "next to," "wearing") between object pairs to enable structured scene understanding.
- **Visual Grounding**: Localizing an image region corresponding to a natural language expression, linking linguistic references to visual content. Labelers were instructed to use unique descriptions to ensure detection targets were unambiguous in the image.
- **Region-wise OCR**: Recognizing and transcribing text within a specified image region (via coordinates or description), supporting fine-grained text understanding in complex visual scenes.
- **Spatial Relationship Comprehension**: Understanding geometric relationships (e.g., "above," "behind," "to the left front of") between objects across diverse 3D views, aiding visual-spatial reasoning.
- **Scene Knowledge Inference**: Inferring high-level semantic or functional information about the scene or making decisions based on visual context.
